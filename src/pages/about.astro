        <p class="text-white light-mode:text-gray-800 text-xl">Programming is more than a work for me. It is a calling :-) A mean to express myself creatively and to harness my brain power to create something that potenitally a lot of people will use. I won't lie, it can be frustrating, there are good and bad days, but more often than not it is exceptionally fullfilling.</p>
