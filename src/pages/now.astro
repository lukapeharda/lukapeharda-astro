            <p class="pb-3 text-white light-mode:text-slate-800 text-xl">Almost six months have passed since my last update and I've been mainly working on the same things - adding Stripe payments to <a href="https://kourses.com/" class="border-b border-e6n-blue hover:bg-e6n-blue" target="_blank">Kourses</a>.</p>
            <p class="pb-3 text-white light-mode:text-slate-800 text-xl">I thought I would be finished in two months but as this is almost mission-critical code we wanted to spend extra time for testing and polishing. Besides, we ended up adding a lot more features than we initially planned as we wanted to give our customers freedom to setup payments according to their needs.</p>
            <p class="pb-3 text-white light-mode:text-slate-800 text-xl">And of course, we need to have everything our competitors have as well ðŸ˜œ</p>
