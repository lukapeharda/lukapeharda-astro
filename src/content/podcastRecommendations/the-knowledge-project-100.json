    "description": "Most Farnam Street (The Knowledge Project) podcast episodes are awesome but the one with Matt Mullenweg from WordPress stands out for me. They discuss remote work (Matt rather calls it distributed) and different levels of it. Matt's saying \"Words create reality\" was something that moved me unexpectedly and was real food for thought. And I can not get over how soothing Matt Mullenweg voice sounds :-)",
