<p class="pb-3 text-slate-400 light-mode:text-slate-800 text-xl"><em>Then I tried it.</em></p>

<p class="pb-3 text-slate-400 light-mode:text-slate-800 text-xl">I had a class that was 133 lines long and I want to see whether I can get it under 100. As the class was already "doing one thing" it didn't make sense to refactor it and split it into two files.</p>
<p class="pb-3 text-slate-400 light-mode:text-slate-800 text-xl">First to go were the comments ðŸ˜€ Method docblocks were replaced with proper type declarations and return types. To preserve the readability, variable and method names had to be changed to be self-explanatory although a bit longer. Conditionals were extracted into separate methods.</p>
<p class="pb-3 text-slate-400 light-mode:text-slate-800 text-xl">Multiple simple <em>IFs</em> were combined into one, which did hurt readability a bit but it saved 5 lines ðŸ˜€</p>
<p class="pb-3 text-slate-400 light-mode:text-slate-800 text-xl">Somewhat duplicated code was extracted and parametrized which allowed me to reuse methods in several locations.</p>
<p class="pb-3 text-slate-400 light-mode:text-slate-800 text-xl">And I got to 99 lines ðŸš€</p>

<p class="pb-3 text-slate-400 light-mode:text-slate-800 text-xl">I was skeptical about this requirement when I started but now I see its benefits. It makes you think about your code a bit more and forces you to make it more readable while also removing clutter from your files. And as strange as this may sound, it was fun doing it ðŸ˜†</p>
