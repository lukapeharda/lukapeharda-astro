I've got a bug report recently that on iPhones, video doesn't play in on [Kourses](https://www.kourses.com), membership SaaS platform that I've been working on.

At first, my heart sank. How could such a basic feature slip through the cracks? After all, this product has been in development for over five years. You'd think we'd have caught something as fundamental as video playback on one of the most popular devices in the world.

But then, I paused.

The bad news is that this bug was caught by a member of our customer.

The good news? This bug was caught by a member of our customer ðŸ˜€

Let that sink in.

We have a customer. A real, live, paying customer. And not only that, our customer has their own customers. That's two layers of validation right there. Sure, the bug is embarrassing, but it's also a sign that we've built something people are actually using.

It's a bittersweet moment, isn't it? On one hand, there's the sting of imperfection â€” the realization that no matter how much you test, something will always slip through. On the other hand, there's the sweet satisfaction of knowing that your product is out in the wild, solving real problems for real people.

This is the reality of building software: it's never truly finished. There will always be bugs, edge cases, and unexpected behaviors. But every bug report is also a sign of life. A reminder that your product is being used, scrutinized, and relied upon.

So, while I'll be rolling up my sleeves to fix this iPhone video playback issue, I'll also be quietly celebrating the fact that we've reached a milestone: we're no longer just building in a vacuum. We're building for someone.
