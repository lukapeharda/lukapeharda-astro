    "description": "This short book (which if you put your mind to it can be read in a couple of hours) is so filled with great advice that I implore you to read it multiple times. Derek Sivers, the creator of CD Baby is describing his success and his failures in a series of short lessons where each one has a great takeaway. Some of the best quotes for me are \"Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently doing what's not working\" and \"No 'yes'. Either 'Hell yeah!' or 'no.'\"",
