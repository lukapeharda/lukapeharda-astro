    "description": "Extremely short book that you'll gulp down in one sitting. Each chapter/answer contradicts with one another which forces you to think really hard how to process it and adjust the ideas to fit within your context. And this is what it makes this book so amazing! My favourite chapter is definitely \"Make a million mistakes\".",
