    "description": "Although this book is intended for project and product managers, every developer can learn a lot from it. Biggest takeaways are definitely the importance of evidence-based decision making vs opinion-based decision making, the importance of understanding the problem you're trying to solve before jumping into solutions, the GIST framework (goals, ideas, steps and tasks) and ICE (impact, confidence and ease) scoring model for work priorization. Oh, and north star metric and how to define value-delivered and value-captured organization goals.",
