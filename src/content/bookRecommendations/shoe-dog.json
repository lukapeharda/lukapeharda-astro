    "description": "Everybody and their grandma keep recommending this book. Both friends and influencers whose recommendation I usually like so I felt compelled to read it. To be frank I don't get what the fuss with this book is all about. There are definitely better biography / memoir books out there. Almost no mentioning of Jordan, Kobe or Tiger. Most of the book is focused on 'ancient' history when they were only re-selling other brands. I don't regret reading the book but nothing more than that.",
