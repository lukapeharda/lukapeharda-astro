    "description": "As I've read the Atomic Habits by James Clear earlier, I was aware of the importance of starting small but, I just wasn't aware how small (or tiny) can you go. The principle of B = MAP (behavior = motivation * ability * prompt) is explained in several ways in the book and the methods accompanying it are brilliant. There are 300 tiny habits and the end of the book to get inspired with and, they are very useful.",
