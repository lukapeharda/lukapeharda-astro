    "description": "The book was highly recommended by a lot of people and after reading it failed to grasp why. Maybe I couldn't get in its flow and couldn't appreciate it? :-) The book isn't bad, but I didn't find anything new that I haven't learned already. Perhaps it was such a big and worthy idea that many authors were inspired by. Maybe I've just started reading it too late.",
